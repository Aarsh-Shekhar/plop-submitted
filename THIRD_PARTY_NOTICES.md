## Evaluated but not vendored

VGGT (Meta), COLMAP, nerfstudio/gsplat, SAM2 / Grounded-SAM-2, TRELLIS
(Microsoft), Open3D were evaluated as the multi-view/GPU path. They are not
compiled into this repo; the reconstruction service exposes a provider seam
(`services/api/app/scene3d.py`, Modal endpoint) where an image-to-3D or
multi-view service plugs in. Check each project's license before enabling it
in a deployment (e.g. SAM2 is Apache-2.0, COLMAP is BSD, but some model
weights carry their own terms).

## Reference material

- BuildCores and `buildcores/buildcores-open-db` were used as an interaction
  reference for Founder mode only. No BuildCores assets, code, or data are
  included.
- `references/demo-hardware.jpg` — "Water cooling setup.jpg", Wikimedia
  Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0. Used as a demo input image.

## Demo room 3D scene

- `apps/web/public/demo3d/` — "Living Room" scene by **Wig42**, via the
  [McGuire Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data/),
  licensed **CC-BY 3.0**. Converted OBJ→GLB with `obj2gltf` (Apache-2.0);
  meshes grouped by material into selectable objects. Attribution required in
  any public deployment.
- `apps/web/src/hive.css` and the hive-scan UI are from this team's own
  team prototype (item-finder).
- `apps/web/public/demo/` — Shapespark CC0 room scene + matched render, and
  `DemoRoom3D`/`demoFurniture` components, pulled from this team's upstream
  team prototype.
- `apps/web/public/demo3d/room-photo.png` (and `-thumb`) — path-traced
  reference render of the same scene ("The White Room" by **Jay-Artist**,
  CC-BY 3.0), via [Benedikt Bitterli's Rendering Resources]
  (https://benedikt-bitterli.me/resources/), tone-adjusted to read as a
  phone capture for the demo flow.
- `apps/web/public/demo3d/dc-photo.png` (and `-thumb`) — NVIDIA liquid-cooled
  AI-factory render (via blogs.nvidia.com, © NVIDIA — editorial/demo use in
  this hackathon project only), cropped and tone-adjusted to read as a phone
  capture for the datacenter demo flow.
